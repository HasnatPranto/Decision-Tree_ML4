# Decision Tree
The breakdown of this ID3 implementation would be something like this:\
-> Make a table with _given_ data\
--> Calculate total entropy\
--> Identify all the branches of each feature and calculate feature entropy\
--> Pick the feature with the highest info gain\
--> Do a divide and conquer, make child tables where feature column will have each branch it at one time\
--> Time for recursion, put these child tables inside the old process\
--> Keep checking for absolute harmony in a branch!\
\\
The tree for the famous "PlayGolf/Tennis" example generated by this code is quite close compared to the tree of the example:p\
